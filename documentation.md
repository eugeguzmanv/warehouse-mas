📦 Multi-Agent Warehouse Simulation DocumentationOverviewThis project simulates a Multi-Agent System (MAS) where autonomous robots cooperate (via a greedy strategy) to organize scattered boxes into orderly stacks. It uses the Mesa framework for Python, leveraging agent-based modeling concepts.🏗 System Architecture1. Agents (agents.py)A. RobotAgentRole: The active worker in the system.State:RETRIEVING: Searching for a box to pick up.STACKING: Carrying a box to a shelf.Capabilities:Perception: Can see boxes and shelves on the entire grid (Simplified "Global Knowledge").Movement: Can move in 4 cardinal directions (North, South, East, West).Collision Avoidance: Checks if a target cell contains another robot before moving. If blocked, it waits or moves randomly.Action: pick_up_box() removes a box from the grid; place_box() increments a shelf's counter.B. BoxRole: Passive entity.Behavior: Sits on the grid until picked up. Once picked up, it is removed from the grid representation.C. ShelfRole: Target destination.Behavior: Keeps track of stack_height. Max capacity is 5.Visualization: Changes color from Grey (Empty) to Black (Full) and displays current count.2. Environment (model.py)Grid: A 20x20 MultiGrid. This allows multiple agents to theoretically exist in one cell (e.g., a Robot on top of a Shelf), but logic prevents Robot-Robot collision.Scheduler: RandomActivation. In every step, agents are activated in a random order to prevent deterministic movement artifacts.Data Collection: Tracks "Total Movements" (efficiency) and "Boxes Stacked" (progress) for real-time graphing.3. Visualization (server.py)CanvasGrid: Renders the 2D grid.🔴 Red Circle: Robot carrying a box.🔵 Blue Circle: Empty Robot.🟫 Brown Square: Box.⬜ Grey/Black Square: Shelf (with number indicating height).Chart: Plots movements and progress over time.🚀 How to RunInstall Dependencies:Open your terminal in the project folder and run:pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch Simulation:Run the server script:python run.py
Access Interface:The terminal will display a URL (usually http://127.0.0.1:8521). Open this in your web browser.Controls:Click Start to run the simulation.Use the Sliders to adjust the number of Robots or Boxes before starting.Watch the chart to analyze efficiency (movements vs. stacked boxes).🧠 Agent Strategy LogicThe agents utilize a Greedy Cost-Based Strategy:If Empty:Calculate distance to all unstacked boxes.Select the closest box.Move one step towards it.If adjacent, pick it up.If Carrying:Calculate distance to all available shelves (height < 5).Select the closest shelf.Move one step towards it.If adjacent, place the box.Collision Resolution:If the desired next step is occupied by another robot, the agent performs a random_move() to attempt to unblock the path or simply waits.
